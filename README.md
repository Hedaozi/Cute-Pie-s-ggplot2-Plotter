# Cute Pie ggplot2 Plotter

The R package [ggplot2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html) and its extensions are powerful and easy to use. But for beginners, it's a little hard to set theme as they want. I still remember I spend a lot time on adjusting details of a ggplot2 plot, such as font family and font size. Besides, the plots shown in RStudio are differnet from plots stored as image. Therefore sometimes you may need time to adjust details for a harmony plot.

So I plan to start a project that allows users to design ggplot2 plots visually. Beginers  can read the plotting code and learn how to set a themed plot. And researchers can save their time.

The project is based on C# and WPF. And I will provide Python version for Mac and Linux users in the future.
